# automagisk
My personal script for patching LineageOS easily to pass safetynet when there is an update.

My personal powershell script to easily patch LineageOs boot img to run safetynet checks successfully (to use banking apps) on my Xiaomi MI 8.
It will work with any LineageOS device, just edit the device name at the beggining of the script.

Right click, run with powershell, wait until the script says you to use the Magisk app, go to your phone, use Magisk to patch the but.img file, when it says "all done!" press enter on the script to resume the operation.
When the phone reboots it should pass the safetynet tests and banking apps should work.
